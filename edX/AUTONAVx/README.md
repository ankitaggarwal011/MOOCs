# EKF and PID Controller

Implementation of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and PID controller for autonomous navigation on a flying robot simulator in Python.

## Motivation

The implementation was a part of an assignment in the course [AUTONAVx](https://www.edx.org/course/autonomous-navigation-flying-robots-tumx-autonavx-0): Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots on edX by Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers from Technische Universität München (TUM). Received 100% grade for this assignment.

## Usage
